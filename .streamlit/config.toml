[client]
# Controls whether uncaught app exceptions and deprecation warnings
# are displayed in the browser. By default, this is set to True and
# Streamlit displays app exceptions and associated tracebacks, and
# deprecation warnings, in the browser.
# If set to False, deprecation warnings and full exception messages
# will print to the console only. Exceptions will still display in the
# browser with a generic error message. For now, the exception type and
# traceback show in the browser also, but they will be removed in the
# future.
# Default: true
showErrorDetails = true

# Change the visibility of items in the toolbar, options menu,
# and settings dialog (top right of the app).
# Allowed values:
# * "auto"      : Show the developer options if the app is accessed through
#                 localhost or through Streamlit Community Cloud as a developer.
#                 Hide them otherwise.
# * "developer" : Show the developer options.
# * "viewer"    : Hide the developer options.
# * "minimal"   : Show only options set externally (e.g. through
#                 Streamlit Community Cloud) or through st.set_page_config.
#                 If there are no options left, hide the menu.
# Default: "auto"
